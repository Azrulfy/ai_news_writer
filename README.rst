The primary purpose of this project is to create a news aggregator that gathers headlines and summaries announcements,
news, and trending information about artificial intelligence and other cool technology stuff. After it has collected
the articles and announcements, I would like it to generate a summary giving the highlights of that week's news.
Ideally, after it has collected and summarized the information, I would like to generate a script based on the
summaries and hopefully do a weekly online show discussing the happenings and other current events.

Additionally, this is an exercise in for me to learn Cookiecutter, Git, ReadTheDocs, and Travis.CI. I have primarily
worked with TFS, SVN, and Jenkins for CI. This will be a *big* learning experience for me. I'm ready to bang my head
against my desk and learn everything I can.

If you would like to contribute this project, please feel free and have fun!
