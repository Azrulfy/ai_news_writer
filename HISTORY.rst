Reconsidering
=============
After adding `pytest-bdd` I became overwhelmed with trying to write the actual test cases for some reason. I
have decided to write regular unit tests for the time being and take a look at BDD at a later date. I don't
want all progress to halt while I try to figure out BDD. I am keeping everything in place up to this point
and will make the build pass, other than that BDD is on hold.

* Started using `pytest-bdd` for feature and test development
* Updated readme file to include some more details and ideas of what I want to accomplish with this project.
